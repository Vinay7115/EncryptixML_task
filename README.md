# EncryptixML_task

My first project was SMS_spam detection where I used various models such as Logistic Regression, Word2Vec and GaussianNB to trained the dataset and try to find out the maximum accuracy.

My Second project was Chrun_Modelling where I used the models such as DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier and Logistic Regression to trained the dataset and try to obtained the maximum accuracy.

My Third project was Credit_card_fraud_detection where I used the models such as Logistic Regression, RandomForestClassifier and DecisionTreeClassifier to trained the dataset and try to obtained the maximum accuracy.



This was my first internship where I gained substantial knowledge and hands-on experience through various projects. I learned to apply theoretical concepts in real-world scenarios, collaborated with a diverse team, and developed problem-solving skills. This experience also enhanced my technical abilities, particularly in areas related to data analysis, data Preprocessing, Training and modelling the data and gave me valuable insights into industry practices.


Thankyou Encryptix Team.
